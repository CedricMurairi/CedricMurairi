## Hi, I'm CÃ©dric

I am a Progressive Engineer; I am currently building Mobile, Mobile Web, and Desktop applications. Open-minded and great team player. My curious mind is always looking for new challenges and better ways to solve problems.
I am focusing on Mobile Cross-Platform Developments, Mobile Web, P.W.A, and overall systems architecture to cut down production costs and efforts needed for systems designs and implementations. With my day-to-day tasks I use technologies like Python, JavaScript, Dart, Flutter, NodeJS, Angular, React, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Firebase and Linux.

Besides software engineering, I have a growing passion for Agriculture, Education, Fine Arts, Embedded Systems, Robotics and Space Engineering. I spend my free time researching and practicing these skills.
I do cooking and action sports to unwind.
