## Hello Devs and Hiring Managers 👋

*My name is Cédric Muriairi an Engineer and Software Engineer; I like to build things we use to get around. Move very fast and burn very hot, just like that. I am passionate about Embedded Systems, Mechatronics, and Space ✨️. Hit my DM for a position or a collaboration in those areas.
Apart from the above, I build software quite often; I mainly write scripts in 5 programming languages, C, Python, Javascript, Dart, Java. Fun fact, I am a Linux user and currently learning Go and Ada.*
