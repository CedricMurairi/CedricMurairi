## Hello Devs and Hiring Managers 👋
#### Student at ALU | Software Engineer | Engineer | Embedded System | Aero&Space Modelling | Business | Heal&Feed the world

My name is Cédric Muriairi a Junior Engineer | Software Engineer, I build software and embedded software; I mainly write scripts in 3 programming languages, Python&Flask, Javascript, and C. Fun fact, I am a Linux user and currently learning GoLang.
I am open-minded and a great team player. I am a stern believer that Curiosity and Perseverance matter for any problem-solving.

Apart from that, I like to build things that turn very fast and burn very hot. I am passionate about Embedded Systems, Mechatronics, and Space ✨️. Hit my DM for collaboration in those areas.

I play music and design for fun; I can work with Sonic Pi and learn while entertaining. I enjoy Photography and going out to do awesome things, like "Hiking." 😀️🌍️
