## Hi, I'm CÃ©dric

Python and JavaScript Engineer, I build mobile, web and desktop applications. Open-minded and great team player. I am a stern believer that curiosity and perseverance are key in picking up new technologies and problem-solving.
Aside from software engineering, I have growing passion for embedded systems, robotics, and space engineering.
Being community and people centered, I believe in a world where people have equal chances to contribute in building tools and technologies they use everyday.
